Hi, I believe Sean has done an amazing job with this project and I plan to adapt it to my cars (I have three classis non-obd cars) and also enhance the features. Maybe along the way I can help someone else too.

Step 1 - Since Seab has not provided a schematic I will work to develop one and publish it.
Step 2 - Test the module on the bench
Step 3 - Test the module in the car
Step 4 - Develop new features
 - Alarm when certain threshholds are passed
 - Wifi capabilities so I can also port the info to my phone (ideally I don't want a "modern digital" screen on my dash so I'd like to be able to read this info/set the parameters via wifi on my phone.
    
   
Stay tuned!
